## My process

I first started by placing some divs to contain the image, paragraph title and the paragraph itself.

After that, I started to style the html by creating an external stylesheet, then i adjusted the style to mimic the design for desktop and mobile.

For the final touch, I adjusted the font sizes and color to make it look like the design preview and formatted the html and css files to make it clean.

### Built with

- Non-semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use css custom properties (variables) to lessen code redundancy for the stylesheet.

### Continued development

I want this web page to be fully responsive in all devices in the future.
